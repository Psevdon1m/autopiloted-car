# 🧠 AI-Powered Self-Driving Car Simulation

This project marks my first step into learning how neural networks work.  
Using a simple HTML + CSS + JavaScript stack and following Radu’s course on neural networks, I built an AI-controlled car that tries to navigate a highway using a basic neural network.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The car is controlled by a feed-forward neural network that starts with random weights.  
There’s no training or backpropagation involved – instead, it uses a simple evolutionary approach:

- Each car runs with random weights and tries to drive as far as possible.
- The best-performing neural network is saved.
- On the next run, new networks are generated by mutating the best one.
- Over time, this helps improve driving performance.

This creates an illusion of learning, even though the system is just selecting and tweaking the best random performers.
